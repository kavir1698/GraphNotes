Convert your research notes to a graph, so that finding a specific piece of information will be easier in the future.

Research requires remembering many facts and details with credible references. It is easy to forget a specific piece of information after a few days or months, or forget where you read it. Scientists usually mark PDF files or write down important details in text documents. These files can quickly pile up and make it tedious to find specific information.

A traditional method for gathering all the necessary information is using paper note cards. In a note card, we write specific information along with their references. We then organize the note cards and use them for writing papers or books. This method has a few drawbacks, namely, it will be difficult to keep all the cards organized as we add more of them, and it will become more difficult to find a specific card quickly. Therefore, people usually prepare and keep a separate set of note cards for each project. This is inefficient.
