# All notes

* A #parameter #interaction arises between input parameters when their simultaneous influence on the model response is not additive ([@BerringtondeGonzalez2007]). #sensitivity
* The average #fertility in #[hunter-gatherer] and agricultural #populations is estimated to be 4.11 births per woman [@Zahid2016]. This sustains an annual #[growth rate] of 0.0004.
* The demise (#extinction) of #Neanderthals at ~41 ka can now be closely tied to the intensity minimum associated with the #[Laschamp magnetic excursion], and the #survival of anatomically modern #humans (#AMHs) can be attributed to differences in the #[aryl hydrocarbon receptor] (#AhR) that has a key role in the evolutionary response to #UVR flux.

# Notes for Science of Science project

## From [@Allo2007]

* The theory of Semantic Information (Carnap & Bar-Hillel (1952)) which was developed as a semantically sensitive modification of Shannon & Weaver’s (1998) Mathematical Theory of Communication. It aims at measuring of information content.
* This idea finds its most general formulation in the Inverse Relationship Principle which relates information to alternatives or possibilities, and is the basic tenet of what we have come to know as the information as range paradigm (Van Benthem (2006+)).
  * Whenever there is an increase in available information there is a decrease in possibilities and vice versa. (Barwise (1997): 491).
* What is characteristic of this description, is that there is no need to explain informational content relative to a previously given set of alternatives a receiver might entertain, for it can straightforwardly be made depend on all possible alternatives.
* the thriving idea behind the notion of informational content: it primarily treats content as a property of sentences or propositions. No reference to an actual informee needs to be made.
* __The Generalized Inverse Relationship Principle (GIRP):__ the informational content of a piece of information is given by the set of cases it excludes.
* A definition of information content of proposition _A_: DEFINITION 2.1 (CLASSICAL CONTENT) CONT(A) = the set of models in S (the set of all models) inconsistent with _A_, namely {$s \in S | s \models \sim A$}.
* DEFINITION 2.2 (CLASSICAL UPDATES) The content of _A_ is the set of cases ruled out by updating the set of all cases with _A_.
* Usually, the standard objection to this classical approach refers to its plainly unintuitive identification of any contradictory piece of information with the maximally informative piece of information (to which Floridi (2004) refers as the Carnap Bar-Hillel Paradox).

# From [@Floridi2010]

* The Mathematical Theory of Communication (MTC) studies information as a probabilistic phenomenon. Its central question is whether and how much uninterpreted data can be encoded and transmitted efficiently by means of a given alphabet and through a given channel. [@Floridi2010 ch. 4]
* MTC is not interested in meaning, reference, relevance, reliability, usefulness, or interpretation of the information exchanged, but only in the level of detail and frequency in the uninterpreted data that constitute it.
* __DBF__ Definition of semantic information: _p_ quantifies as factual semantic information if and only if _p_ is (constituted by) _well-formed_, _meaningful_, and _veridical_ _data_.
* **_Q: What is the difference between knowledge and information?_**
* Knowledge and information are members of the same conceptual family. What the former enjoys and the latter lacks is the web of mutual relations that allow one part of it to account for another. Shatter that, and you are left with a pile of truths or a random list of bits of information that cannot help to make sense of the reality they seek to address.
* Difference between factual semantic content and factual semantic information is that the latter needs to be true, whereas the former can also be false.
* DBF plays a crucial role in the solution of the so-called Bar-Hillel Carnap paradox.

# From [@Uzzi2018]

* Science of science has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and __the scientific horizon__ (A good #terminology to use).
* For example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become omre likely to make major breakthroughs.
* Another example, SciSci has found that mall teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact [@Wu2019].
* Early studies discovered an exponential #growth in the volume of #[scientific literature] [@Price1963], a trend that continues with an average doubling period of 15 years (Fig. 1 [@Uzzi2018]).
* Large-scale text analysis, using phrases extracted from titles and abstracts to measure the cognitive extent of the #[scientific literature], have found that the conceptual territory of science expands linearly with time. In other words, whereas the number of publications #grows exponentially, the space of #ideas expands only linearly (Fig. 1) [@Milojevic2015;@Uzzi2018].
* When #scientists choose new topics, they prefer things directly related o their current #expertise or that of their #collaborators [@Uzzi2018;@Shi2015].
* It has been long hypothesized that #scientists' choice of #[research problems] to work on are shaped by an ongoing tension between productive tradition and risky innovation [@Uzzi2018;@Bourdieu1975].  Scientists who adhere to a research tradition in their domain often appear productive by publishing a steady stream of contributions that advance a focused research agenda. But a focused agenda may limit a researcher’s ability to sense and seize opportunities for staking out new ideas that are required to grow the field’s knowledge. For example, a case study focusing on biomedical scientists choosing novel chemicals and chemical relationships shows that as fields mature, researchers tend to focus increasingly on established knowledge [@Foster2015].
* Although an innovative #publication tends to result in higher #impact than a conservative one, high-#risk innovation strategies are rare, because the additional #reward does not compensate for the risk of failure to #publish at all [@Uzzi2018]. #incentive
* Scientific #awards and accolades appear to function as primary #incentives to resist conservative tendencies and encourage betting on exploration and surprise [@Foster2015]. #science #risk #reward
* Conservative #strategies [@Rzhetsky2015] serve individual careers well but are less effective for #science as a whole [@Uzzi2018].
* The #[file drawer problem]: #[Negative results], at odds with established hypotheses, are rarely published, leading to a systemic bias in published research and the canonization of weak and sometimes false facts [@Nissen2016]. #science
