* Science of science has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and __the scientific horizon__ (A good terminology to use).
* For #example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become more likely to make major breakthroughs.
* Another #example, SciSci has found that mall teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact [@Wu2019].
* Early studies discovered an exponential #growth in the volume of #[scientific literature] [@Price1963], a trend that continues with an average doubling period of 15 years (Fig. 1 [@Uzzi2018]).
* Large-scale text analysis, using phrases extracted from titles and abstracts to measure the cognitive extent of the #[scientific literature], have found that the conceptual territory of science expands linearly with time. In other words, whereas the number of publications #grows exponentially, the space of #ideas expands only linearly (Fig. 1) [@Milojevic2015;@Uzzi2018].
* When #scientists choose new topics, they prefer things directly related o their current #expertise or that of their #collaborators [@Uzzi2018;@Shi2015].
* It has been long hypothesized that #scientists' choice of #[research problems] to work on are shaped by an ongoing tension between productive tradition and risky innovation [@Uzzi2018;@Bourdieu1975].  Scientists who adhere to a research tradition in their domain often appear productive by publishing a steady stream of contributions that advance a focused research agenda. But a focused agenda may limit a researcher’s ability to sense and seize opportunities for staking out new ideas that are required to grow the field’s knowledge. For example, a case study focusing on biomedical scientists choosing novel chemicals and chemical relationships shows that as fields mature, researchers tend to focus increasingly on established knowledge [@Foster2015].
* Although an innovative #publication tends to result in higher #impact than a conservative one, high-#risk innovation strategies are rare, because the additional #reward does not compensate for the risk of failure to #publish at all [@Uzzi2018]. #incentive
* Scientific #awards and accolades appear to function as primary #incentives to resist conservative tendencies and encourage betting on exploration and surprise [@Foster2015]. #science #risk #reward
* Conservative #strategies [@Rzhetsky2015] serve individual careers well but are less effective for #science as a whole [@Uzzi2018].
* The #[file drawer problem]: #[Negative results], at odds with established hypotheses, are rarely published, leading to a systemic bias in published research and the canonization of weak and sometimes false facts [@Nissen2016]. #science
